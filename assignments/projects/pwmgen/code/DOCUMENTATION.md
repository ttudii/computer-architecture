### COMMUNICATION BRIDGE

```
reg [1:0] sclk_sync, cs_sync;
```

The registers `sclk_sync` and `cs_sync` implement **double-flop synchronization** for the external SPI signals (`sclk` and `cs_n`). Even if the SPI master and the internal peripheral operate at similar frequencies, the clocks are not phase-aligned, meaning the incoming signals must be synchronized to the internal `clk` domain to prevent metastability.

Each synchronizer register stores **two bits**, corresponding to the two most recently sampled values of the external signal. They are initialized to:

- `sclk_sync = 2'b00`
- `cs_sync = 2'b11` (since chip select is active-low)

On every `posedge clk`, the new sampled value is appended:

```
sclk_sync <= {sclk_sync[0], sclk};
cs_sync   <= {cs_sync[0], cs_n};
```

This enables detection of **rising edges**, **falling edges**, and **chip-select activation** through simple bit-pattern comparisons.

---

The SPI logic uses a 3-bit register `byte_cnt` to track the number of bits received within the current byte. Since the system processes only **one byte at a time**, this counter asserts completion once all 8 bits have been shifted in.

The module also contains two 8-bit shift registers:

- `shift_in` — stores the data received from MOSI (and is exposed via `data_in`)
- `shift_out` — contains the byte to be transmitted on MISO

```
reg [2:0] byte_cnt;
reg [7:0] shift_in, shift_out;
reg miso_reg;
assign miso = miso_reg;
assign data_in = shift_in;
```

### **SPI Timing Logic: `sclk_rising`, `sclk_falling`, and `cs_active`**

The synchronized SPI signals allow the design to derive the following control events:

- **`sclk_rising`** — SCLK transitions from `0`  to `1`
- **`sclk_falling`** — SCLK transitions from `1` to `0`
- **`cs_active`** — chip-select is asserted (`cs_n == 0`)

These signals determine when bits are received or transmitted.

---

### **Main State Machine (`always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n)`)**

On each rising edge of the internal clock (or falling edge of reset):

#### **1. Reset Condition**
If `rst_n == 0`, all internal registers are set to known values:

- `byte_cnt` resets to `0`
- `shift_in` and `shift_out` clear to `0`
- `miso_reg` outputs `0`

#### **2. Idle State (`cs_active == 0`)**
If reset is not asserted and chip-select is inactive:

- The byte counter is cleared.
- The next transmit byte (`data_out`) is loaded into `shift_out`.
- The first bit to be transmitted (`data_out[7]`) is prepared in `miso_reg`.

This stage prepares the slave before the SPI master begins a transfer.

---

### **3. Active SPI Transfer (`cs_active == 1`)**

When a transaction is active, three possible events occur:

#### **1. `sclk_rising` — Receiving a bit on MOSI**
On the rising edge of SCLK:

- `shift_in` shifts left by one bit.
- The newest MOSI bit is inserted as the least significant bit.
- `byte_cnt` increments.

This corresponds to **data reception**.

#### **2. `sclk_falling` — Sending a bit on MISO**
On the falling edge of SCLK:

- `shift_out` shifts left.
- A `0` is inserted as the LSB.
- `shift_out[6]` is copied into `miso_reg`.

This performs **data transmission**.

#### **3. End-of-Byte Handling (when `byte_cnt == 7`)**
On the rising edge when the last bit of the byte has been received:

- `shift_out` is reloaded with the next `data_out`.
- `miso_reg` is updated with the new MSB (`data_out[7]`).

This supports continuous multi-byte transfers.

---

### **Byte Completion Signal (`byte_sync`)**

The final `always` block generates a single-cycle strobe named `byte_sync` using the internal register `byte_sync_reg`.

A pulse is generated when:

- `cs_active == 1`
- `sclk_rising == 1`
- `byte_cnt == 7`

At this moment, the full 8-bit value in `shift_in` is valid and ready for the downstream logic.

This signal is essential for the component that decodes or processes the received SPI byte.
